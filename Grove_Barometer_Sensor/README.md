This Grove - Barometer Sensor features a Bosch BMP085 high-accuracy chip to detect barometric pressure and temperature. It can widely measure pressure ranging from 300hPa to 1100hPa, AKA +9000m to -500m above sea level, with a super high accuracy of 0.03hPa(0.25m) in ultra-high resolution mode.The chip only accepts 1.8V to 3.6V input voltage. However, with outer circuit added, this module becomes compatible with 3.3V and 5V. Therefore, it can be used on Arduino/Seeeduino or Seeeduino Stalker without modification.It is designed to be connected directly to a micro-controller via the I2C bus.

### Usage:

1. Clone this repo or download as a zip;
2. Unzip the zip file if you downloaded a zip file;
3. Copy the directory "Grove_Barometer_Sensor" into Arduino's libraries directory;
4. Open Arduino IDE, go to "File"->"Examples"->"Grove_Barometer_Sensor"

Assume that you connected the grove correctly.
